I am an Assistant Professor at Dept. of Software Convergence, KyungHee University, Korea. Before joining KyungHee University, I was a research intern at Naver Cloud (CLOVA). I received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in [Image and Video Pattern Recognition Lab.](http://mvp.yonsei.ac.kr/), School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University, Korea, in 2023, and B.S degree in School of Electronic Engineering at KyungHee University, Korea, in 2018, respectively. My research interests include Computer Vision, Computational Photography, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning – from processing images and videos, to applying and analyzing with pattern recognition. Particularly, I focus on visual (image/video) representation learning with vaious models, datasets, and supervisions. Recently, my research topics are about video anomaly detection, face recognition, and 3d scene reconstruction.
